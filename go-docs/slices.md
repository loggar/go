# Slice

## Variables

```
In golang,
a := []StructType
Is a a pointer?
```

No, `a` is not a pointer in this case. The syntax `a := []StructType` creates a slice, which is a dynamic, reference-like data structure in Go.

Here's a breakdown:

- `[]StructType` declares a slice of `StructType`
- It's a reference type, but not a pointer in the traditional sense
- Slices contain:
  1. A pointer to an underlying array
  2. The length of the slice
  3. Its capacity

A few key points:

- Slices are passed by value, but they contain an internal pointer to the underlying array
- Modifications to the slice can affect the original underlying array
- If you want an actual pointer to a slice, you'd use `*[]StructType`

For example:

```go
type MyStruct struct {
    Name string
}

a := []MyStruct{}  // This is a slice, not a pointer
b := &[]MyStruct{} // This is a pointer to a slice
```
