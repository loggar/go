In the above example, we have opened the file and loaded the content into the f variable. the contents are read with the help of the NewReader function which returns a reader object which further can be used to read contents into chunks of bytes. The chunk_size defines the size we want to use for reading the content, chunk_list as a slice of strings which will hold the slice of chunks/bytes as a type caste into a slice of strings. With the Read function, the bytes are read into the function, and the buffer is split as per the chunk size obtained in the Read function. We append the slice of bytes into the sliced array and thereby we obtain the slice of strings.
