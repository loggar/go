Certainly! You want to modify your test logging to display only the differences between the expected and actual `VersionUpgrade` protobuf messages, using '+' and '-' symbols (like a unified diff). This approach makes it easier to identify exactly what is different without overwhelming the logs with entire data structures.

Here's how you can achieve this:

1. **Use the `cmp` package from `google/go-cmp`**: This package provides utilities for comparing Go values, and with the `protocmp` package, it can compare protobuf messages effectively.

2. **Leverage `protocmp.Transform()`**: This function helps `cmp` to understand how to compare protobuf messages deeply, handling the nuances of protobuf comparisons.

3. **Modify your test code to include the diff**: Replace the logging part to use `cmp.Diff` and log only the differences.

### **Step-by-Step Guide**

#### **1. Import Necessary Packages**

Add the following imports to your test file:

```go
import (
    "testing"

    "github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp"
    "google.golang.org/protobuf/testing/protocmp"
)
```

- **`github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp`**: Provides comparison functions.
- **`google.golang.org/protobuf/testing/protocmp`**: Provides protobuf-specific comparison options for `cmp`.

#### **2. Modify Your Test Code**

Replace your logging part with the following code:

```go
if !assert.True(t, proto.Equal(expectedResult.VersionUpgrade, reply.VersionUpgrade), "VersionUpgrade mismatch") {
    diff := cmp.Diff(expectedResult.VersionUpgrade, reply.VersionUpgrade, protocmp.Transform())
    t.Logf("VersionUpgrade difference (-expected +actual):\n%s", diff)
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Check for Equality**: The `proto.Equal` function checks if the two protobuf messages are equal.
- **Generate the Diff**: If they are not equal, use `cmp.Diff` with `protocmp.Transform()` to generate a diff of the differences.
- **Log the Differences**: Use `t.Logf` to log the diff, which will include '+' and '-' symbols indicating additions and deletions.

#### **3. Full Example**

Here's the full modified test snippet:

```go
import (
    "testing"

    "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
    "github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp"
    "google.golang.org/protobuf/proto"
    "google.golang.org/protobuf/testing/protocmp"
)

func TestVersionUpgrade(t *testing.T) {
    // ... setup code ...

    if !assert.True(t, proto.Equal(expectedResult.VersionUpgrade, reply.VersionUpgrade), "VersionUpgrade mismatch") {
        diff := cmp.Diff(expectedResult.VersionUpgrade, reply.VersionUpgrade, protocmp.Transform())
        t.Logf("VersionUpgrade difference (-expected +actual):\n%s", diff)
    }

    // ... rest of the test ...
}
```

#### **4. How It Works**

- **`cmp.Diff`**: Compares two values and returns a human-readable report of the differences.
- **`protocmp.Transform()`**: An option that tells `cmp` how to handle protobuf messages properly, including handling of default values and unknown fields.
- **Diff Output**: The output will show differences with lines prefixed by '-' for deletions (expected but not present in actual) and '+' for additions (present in actual but not expected).

### **Example Output**

When the test fails, the log might look like:

```
VersionUpgrade difference (-expected +actual):
  &VersionUpgrade{
    Version: "1.0.0",
-   FeatureFlag: true,
+   FeatureFlag: false,
  }
```

This output indicates that the `FeatureFlag` field differs between the expected and actual `VersionUpgrade` messages.

### **Additional Tips**

- **Use `t.Errorf` Instead of `t.Logf`**: If you prefer the test to fail immediately and log the difference as an error, you can use `t.Errorf`:

  ```go
  if !proto.Equal(expectedResult.VersionUpgrade, reply.VersionUpgrade) {
      diff := cmp.Diff(expectedResult.VersionUpgrade, reply.VersionUpgrade, protocmp.Transform())
      t.Errorf("VersionUpgrade mismatch (-expected +actual):\n%s", diff)
  }
  ```

- **Use `assert.Equal` for Simpler Code**: The `testify/assert` package has an `Equal` function that can compare protobuf messages, but it might not provide detailed diffs for complex structures:

  ```go
  assert.Equal(t, expectedResult.VersionUpgrade, reply.VersionUpgrade, "VersionUpgrade mismatch")
  ```

  However, for better diff output, using `cmp.Diff` with `protocmp.Transform()` is recommended.

### **Why Use `cmp.Diff` and `protocmp`**

- **Deep Comparison**: Handles deep comparisons of complex protobuf messages.
- **Readable Diff Output**: Provides clear and concise diff output, making it easier to identify discrepancies.
- **Protobuf Awareness**: `protocmp` understands protobuf semantics, such as default values and field presence.

### **Conclusion**

By modifying your test code to use `cmp.Diff` with `protocmp.Transform()`, you can effectively display only the differences between your expected and actual protobuf messages using '+' and '-' symbols. This makes your test logs more informative and helps quickly identify issues during testing.
